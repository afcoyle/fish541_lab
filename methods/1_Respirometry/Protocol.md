### Set-up
The PreSens 10-Channel OXY-10 ST (G2) oxygen meter was used with Oxygen Dipping Probe DP-PSt7 and after market temperature probes to assess the oxygen consumption of mussels. The meter, probe, and technical specifications of the meter are found below. The meter guide is unavailable online as this model has been discontinued.

The meter uses PreSens source software. We used a computer with the software loaded, version 2.1.0.443, according to the start-up specifications in the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/afcoyle/fish541_lab/blob/main/methods/1_Respirometry/PreSensQuickStartGuide.pdf)

### Pre-treatment assessment
* The oxygen meter was set up by connecting all probes (1 oxygen and 1 temperature) to a channel and ensuring recognition of all channels in the software user interface. 
* Water was added to the approximate halfway point of a large opaque storage container and chilled to match the control tank temperature of 12C. A shelf was placed in the container to support individual mussel chambers and ensure at least half of the chamber was submerged in the water for proper assessment. Control mussels were taken from the control tank, labeled, and placed in a clear plastic chamber. The clear plastic container was a small tupperware rectangle that was completely filled with tank water and covered with a lid - each container held one mussel. The lid had predrilled holes for probe insertion. 
* After inserting one oxygen and one temperature probe into each chamber, chamber identifiers (written in indelible marker on the lids) were matched to their corresponding channels in the software interface. Once complete, the software was run for 30 minutes to capture times series data for each mussel.
* At the end of 30 minutes the mussels were removed from their chambers and returned to their holding tank. Data was logged and exported to the lab GitHub repository.

### Post-treatment assessment
* All set-up steps for the oxygen meter and chamber prep were completed in the same manner as the pre-treatment assessment. The water in the storage container was heated to 18C to match treatment temperature. 
* Mussels from treatment A and treatment B were labeled and placed in individual chambers for evaluation. Each channel was assigned to its corresponding chamber and the assessment was run for 30 minutes. This process was repeated until all mussels from both treatments were assessed.
