# Methods for analyzing data from qPCR

1. take Cq values and average based on mussel number

2. calculate Delta Cq by subtracting average Cq values from a standard normal value of 40(Cq)

3. calculate the average Delta Cq of the controls

4. calculate the Delta Delta Cq by subtracting the Delta Cq values from the average Delta Cq of the controls

5.
