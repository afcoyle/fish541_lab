### Primer selection
Primers were initially selected according to the methods used in [DNA Damage and Transcriptional Changes in the Gills of Mytilus galloprovincialis Exposed to Nanomolar Doses of Combined Metal Salts (Cd, Cu, Hg)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054602#pone.0054602-Livak1)

The following primers for stress related genes were tested using pooled cDNA samples from all 20 individuals in experiment 1.

Good amplification was observed for HSC70 and GADD45 gamma, so we selected primers for these genes as our stress response biomarkers. We used HSC70 and GADD45 gamma primers to complete qPCR for all samples from both experiments 1 and 2.

### cDNA dilution
Create 1:10 dilutions for each cDNA sample to be run through qPCR:
* 18ul molecular grade H2O
* 2ul sample

### Primer dilution
Forward and reverse primers are sent at 100uM concentration. Dilute primers to 10uM for qPCR. For each primer:
* 90ul molecular grade H2O
* 10ul primer

Resulting in:
* 100ul of 10uM HSC70 Forward
* 100ul of 10uM HSC70 Reverse
* 100ul of 10uM GADD45 gamma Forward
* 100ul of 10uM GADD45 gamma Reverse

### Mix Preparation and Plating
**Separate mix made for each primer set, one for HSC70 F/R and another for GADD45 gamma**

Prepare enough mix for each cDNA sample, a replicate for each cDNA sample, and 2 H2O controls per primer set (HSC70 and GADD45 gamma).

Create mix of dNTPs, buffer, polymerase, molecular grade H20, and forward/reverse primers made to follow specifications per sample:
* 10ul Super Mix (includes 5X M-MLV RT Buffer, 10nM dNTPs, M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase)
* 7ul molecular grade H2O
* 1ul Forward 10uM primer
* 1ul Reverse 10uM primer
Final volume per well before sample cDNA addition = 19ul

* Aliquot mix into 96 well plate 
* Add 1ul of 1:10 cDNA dilutions to wells (2 wells per dilution for replicate)

Final volume per well should be 20ul

### qPCR run and data collection
Plate preparation checklist before run:
* Ensure caps are completely closed
* Spin down plate
* Wipe cap tops with kim wipe

Place plate in qPCR machine and run samples using the SYBR protocol.

After run is complete, download data files and proceed to analysis.
