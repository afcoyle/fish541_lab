### Primer selection
Primers were initially selected according to the methods used in [DNA Damage and Transcriptional Changes in the Gills of Mytilus galloprovincialis Exposed to Nanomolar Doses of Combined Metal Salts (Cd, Cu, Hg)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0054602#pone.0054602-Livak1)

The following primers for stress related genes were tested using pooled cDNA samples from all 20 individuals in experiment 1.

Good amplification was observed for HSC70 and GADD45 gamma, so we selected primers for these genes as our stress response biomarkers. We used HSC70 and GADD45 gamma primers to complete qPCR for all samples from both experiments 1 and 2.

### cDNA dilution
A 1:10 dilution was made for each cDNA sample to be run through qPCR:
* 18ul molecular grade H2O
* 2ul sample

### Super Mix Preparation


### Plating

### qPCR run and data collection
